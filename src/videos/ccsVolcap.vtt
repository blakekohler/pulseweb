00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.540
the poll surveys have been really

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.250
helpful for me just as a way to gather

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810
feedback not only does polls for good

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.400
gather feedback from our guests but they

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.519
also got a feedback from our volunteers

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.280
where we see about 9000 volunteers per

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.039
year at our agency that is a huge

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.680
time-saver it's great for that feedback

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.650
and allows us to really make the changes

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.050
to make sure that volunteers guests

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.920
anybody a staff to is having a positive

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.920
experience here
