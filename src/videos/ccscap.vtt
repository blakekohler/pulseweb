00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.270
Pulse has been a game-changer for us for the
past two years.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.660
Pulse For Good is vital in making sure our
volunteers are having a positive experience.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.320
Getting daily responses from the guests that
are using our services provides us with extra

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.340
insight into a snapshot of their lives.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.310
I've been coordinating volunteers for about
seven years in different capacities now in

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.599
many positions I've worked in before there
hasn't been a great way to do that.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.859
It really helps us understand what they're
going through how they are using our services

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.030
and what we can do better.
