00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.449

operating officer for I'm the director

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.900
of administrative services here at

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.660
Valley Behavioral Health Valley is the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
largest behavioral health provider

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.850

abuse services autism services and the

full continuum of care for all ages

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.470
I love the pulse product because it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.869
gives me insight into the client

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.230
satisfaction immediately we were

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.850
utilizing some hand tracking methodology

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.559
and a ton of staff to make sure we were

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
tracking that our information was very

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
delayed we were finding out months later

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.820
about client experience issues that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.040
needed to be solved with more efficiency

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
last year when you look at the data

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.950
before we implemented pulse from January

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.590
to April we had no satisfaction surveys

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.750
whatsoever on any of our clients going

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.210
into 20/20 with pulse fully implemented

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.000
across the organization I already have

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
about 900 responses for client

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.629
satisfaction

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.760
at the end of February before we had

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.340
pulse for good we had we would use paper

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.310
customer satisfaction surveys and those

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.180
were helpful but it was hard to compile

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.710
the data and week we could gather themes

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
that we wanted to address in our

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
programs to help improve our patient

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
experience but it didn't give it it was

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.400
hard because we had to compile it type

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
it out and then also I think our clients

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
were a little bit nervous to really talk

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.920
about what's going on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
for them because they're handing the the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.790
survey back to somebody so it didn't

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.710
feel as confidential yeah I think pulse

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.530
for good has allowed us opportunities to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.290
see deep down into the workforce areas

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.920
where there are winds with particular

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.380
staff or quality of care that allow us

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.180
to acknowledge those staff in ways that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100
maybe they have been missed in the past

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.259
and felt like they haven't been

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.810
recognized I would say if organizations

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.630
like ours are not using pulse for good

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
they are missing valuable information to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
drive the process improvement and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.549
excellence in client care I absolutely

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.280
recommend pulse to other organization

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.099
if you need to gather satisfaction data

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.610
the post kiosks and surveys are the way

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.650
to go

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.569
we love the dashboards they're super

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.030
easy to read I would highly recommend

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.440
pulse for other organizations like ours

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.049
I think it really creates a safe

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.940
environment it allows them to get in

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.099
time data on the things that they're

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.140
wondering about and it really cuts out

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.290
that extra administrative time with

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.510
these paper surveys I love working with

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.220
the vendor really I mean I I implement a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.280
lot of software's and I do a lot of work

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.079
with technology and vendors and I can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.720
say without reservation pulses like the

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.940
best vendor ever I really like working

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.340
with the team they're super responsive

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.780
they're super quick they use the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.790
communication methods that work best for

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.910
our team whether that's being on slack

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.799
being on email calling them they've done

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.930
a lot of customizations for us on

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.110
request so the product is great the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.650
support is great and I definitely

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.159
recommend

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.159
